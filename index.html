          <h1>Ten Tac Toe</h1>
          <p>
            Bored with classic X and O? Ten-Tac-Toe is a deep extension of its
            ubiquitous, simple counterpart, with no known deterministic winning
            strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Play against a world-class AI with varying difficulties, or online
            with your friends.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4 col-md-push-8">
              <h2>Rules</h2>
              <img src="../assets/ut3-rules.png" height="400px" width="400px" />
              <br />
              <br />

              <p>
                The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the
                81 empty spots. This move "sends" their opponent to its relative
                location. For example, if X played in the top right square of
                their local board, then O needs to play next in the local board
                at the top right of the global board. O can then play in any one
                of the nine available spots in that local board, each move
                sending X to a different local board.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a move is played so that it is to win a local board by the
                rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then the entire local board is
                marked as a victory for the player in the global board. Once a
                local board is won by a player, or it is filled completely, no
                more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to
                such a board, then that player may play in any other board. Game
                play ends when either a player wins the global board or there
                are no legal moves remaining, in which case the game is a draw.

              <p>
                While regular tic-tac-toe is elementary to solve and can be done
                nearly instantly using depth-first search, ten-tac-toe cannot be
                reasonably solved using any brute-force tactics. Therefore, more
                creative computer implementations are necessary to play this
                game.
              </p>
              <p>
                I use Minimax to implement the AI - a search tree is created of
                all the possible moves, and the AI plays the move that maximizes
                our evaluation function. Since there is a lot of branching in
                Ultimate T3, I also use alpha-beta pruning to reduce the size of
                the search tree so the AI can make moves in a reasonable amount
                of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The AI, at the hardest difficulty, can easily beat the best
                human players at the game.
